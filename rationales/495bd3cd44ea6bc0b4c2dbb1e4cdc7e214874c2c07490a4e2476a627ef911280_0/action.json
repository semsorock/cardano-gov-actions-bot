However this independent infrastructure comes at significant running cost.\n\nIn order to ensure Tempo.Vote will continue running smoothly to service Cardano community, we are seeking to withdraw from Treasury 380k ADA for the 6 month period (1 Aug 2025 - 31 Jan 2026) with the following breakdown:\n- Infrastructure Cost: 200k ADA\n- Development Cost: 180k ADA",
