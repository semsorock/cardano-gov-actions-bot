    "summary": "After reviewing the Tempo.Vote Budget Info Action proposal in light of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution, EMURGO finds that this proposal does not fully comply with the constitutional requirements for a Treasury Withdrawal and associated budget.\n",
    "rationaleStatement": "Article III section 5\n\nThe proposal is extremely light on documentation. There is no detailed budget spreadsheet, no delivery timeline, and insufficient information for DReps to make informed decisions. Requiring DReps to search for details externally, like Selfdriven site, defeats the purpose of “legible and standarized” proposals as mandated in this section. \n\nArticle IV, Section 2\n\nWhile the proposal designates Selfdriven as the budget administrator, it does not include an explicit oversight structure in the proposal text. There are no clearly defined milestones, progress metrics, or reporting mechanisms. These are critical to meeting the constitutional expectation of transparent fund administration.\n\nArticle IV, Section 4\n\nThis section mandates that proposals must include an allocation for independent audits, defined oversight metrics, and contractual dispute resolution mechanisms. These elements are not explicitly stated in the proposal. While Selfdriven’s services may include such provisions, the Constitution requires these to be part of the governance action itself to ensure clarity and enforceability.\n\nArticle IV, Section 5\n\nThe proposal fails to disclose the stake addresses that would receive treasury funds. As a result, it is not possible to verify whether these addresses are configured with Auto-Abstain, as required by this article\n\nProcedural Diligence\n\nThe title includes a typo: “Cardono” instead of Cardano. While this might seem minor, it reflects lack of diligence in a governance process involving public funds and significant commitments.\n",
    "conclusion": "EMURGO concludes that this governance action is not yet constitutional. While the intent and direction of the proposal are aligned with ecosystem goals, the governance action does not currently meet the structural, oversight, and transparency requirements outlined in the Cardano Constitution. EMURGO encourages the proposer to revise the submission by explicitly addressing Articles IV.2, IV.4, and IV.5 within the proposal content to ensure full compliance.",
