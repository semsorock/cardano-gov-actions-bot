    "summary": "We consider this governance action to be constitutional.",
    "rationaleStatement": "This governance action extends the term of the existing Net Change Limit (NCL) without modifying its total amount. As such, it remains fully compliant with the Treasury Guardrails defined in Appendix I, Section 3 — particularly TREASURY-01a(x) and TREASURY-02a(x) — which govern the application and continuity of a previously established NCL. The extension ensures continued treasury operations beyond the original expiration date and preserves the spending ceiling agreed upon by the Cardano Community. Therefore, we deem this governance action to be constitutional.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "None",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "Some concerns were raised regarding the timing of the extension, noting that the year-end concentration of budget submissions and Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions may have contributed to the need for this proposal. Going forward, improved coordination around the sequencing of budget preparation and NCL renewal may help reduce similar timing pressures. Nonetheless, these concerns relate to procedural efficiency rather than constitutionality.",
    "conclusion": "For the reasons stated above, we determine that it is constitutional.",
