    "rationaleStatement": "Article IV, Section 2\n\nThe proposal designates a responsible administrator and outlines a clear process for oversight. It includes mechanisms for fund transparency and governance, which align with the principles of smart contract utilization and blockchain-based tools for administration.\n\nArticle IV, Section 4\n\nThe funding request includes provisions for independent audits and oversight metric, covered by the 'ad-hoc' scope. An off-chain legal framework under PRAGMA’s Maintener Committee Framework makes provision for dispute resolution in regards to this treasury withdrawal. These elements satisfy the requirement for ensuring proper accountability of treasury funds and dispute resolution.\n\nArticle IV, Section 5\n\nThe proposal commits to using separate, auditable accounts for treasury funds and confirms that these accounts will be delegated to the predefined auto-abstain option, in accordance with constitutional guardrails. \n\nCardano Blockchain Guardrails – Treasury Withdrawals\n\nAt the time of the submission, the request is within the approved net change limit as required by TREASURY-01a and TREASURY-02a.\n\nThe treasury withdrawal is clearly denominated in ADA (TREASURY-03a).\n\nThe governance action aligns with an approved ecosystem budget and does not proceed without prior authorization, with a prior Info Action that has passed the threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake. (TREASURY-04a).\n",
    "conclusion": "In conclusion, we confirm that the Amaru proposal is constitutional, as it adheres to the principles of decentralized governance, transparent fund management, and ongoing development outlined in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution.",
