The structure and content align with the Cardano Constitution.\n\n**Constitutional Alignment**\n\n* **Procedural Requirements (Article III, Section 5):** The well-documented proposal is in standardized, legible format with required rationale and verifiable metadata links. The on-chain and off-chain identity of the proposer was independently correlated by an Ace Alliance member.\n\n* **Funds Administration (Article IV):** The proposal names Intersect as administrator, establishes milestone-based oversight through a board of advisors, and provides for an independent audit allocation to satisfy Article IV, Section 4\\.\n\n* **Funds Handling (Article IV, Section 5):** For any ada received from subsequent treasury withdrawal actions held directly or indirectly by Intersect as administrator, the proposers commit to not delegate such ada to an SPO, and to delegate such ada to the predefined auto abstain voting option.   \n* **Disclosure:** One Ace Alliance member reviewed the governance action metadata prior to submission. This did not affect the decision of Ace Alliance.",
