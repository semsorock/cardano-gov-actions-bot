    "title": "Withdraw ₳212,000 for AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer",
    "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer** which will provide the following services:\n\nWe propose to continue development and support of the AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer for the next 24 months. Planned work includes performance optimizations, improvements to UX/UI, and new features related to Cardano's evolving governance model and on-chain tooling.\n\nThe frontend is developed using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, which allows very small bundle size and fast loading time on different devices. The backend is built on Node.js and PostgreSQL, combining standard DB-Sync tables with custom-optimized indexes for high-speed data access. This dual approach enables advanced search and filtering across both on-chain and off-chain metadata --- including DRep names, stake pool tickers, token labels, and more.\n\nInfrastructure is horizontally scalable. Multiple backend servers work behind load balancer and handle traffic based on real-time utilization. This gives high availability and stable performance, even during peak usage.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
    "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nIt's still a challenge to provide Cardano blockchain data in a way that's both decentralized and easy to use. Blockchain explorers are key tools in solving this issue, as they provide access to information about blocks, transactions, stake pools, governance activities, and other on-chain operations. However, each explorer is also potential point of centralization --- it can fail, or show incorrect data. Because of this, it is important for ecosystem to have several independent, performant, and open-source explorers.\n\nAdaStat.net supports this goal by providing real-time, mobile-optimized, and feature-rich explorer for Cardano. Maintaining and improving AdaStat directly strengthens the ecosystem infrastructure, increase transparency of data, and offer valuable tool for SPOs, DReps, CC members, developers, and everyday users.",
    "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n1. For SPOs: Real-time access to block production and stake pool performance, without delays from epoch boundaries or outdated data.\n\n2. For DReps and CC members: Tools for tracking governance activities and accessing voting-related data in clear and transparent way.\n\n3. For developers: Access to fully free REST API that provides Cardano data in easy-to-use JSON format --- helpful for building tools, dashboards, or integrating blockchain data into other applications.\n\n4. For general users: The site works smoothly on all devices, and we keep improving it based on user feedback.\n\n5. For the Cardano ecosystem: AdaStat is a lightweight and open tool that helps Cardano stay decentralized and easy to understand - especially for new users. All of this helps Cardano grow: stronger infrastructure, clearer data, and better long-term adoption.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAdaStat.net has been actively developed and maintained since Shelley Incentivized Testnet in 2019, with consistent uptime, feature updates, and strong organic community usage. The team has years of experience working with Cardano node, DB-Sync, performance tuning, database optimization, and community engagement. This shows that we've been consistently improving the project over the years, and we plan to keep doing so.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
