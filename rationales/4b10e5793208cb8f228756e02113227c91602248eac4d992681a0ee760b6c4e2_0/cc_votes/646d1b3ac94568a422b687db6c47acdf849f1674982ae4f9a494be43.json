    "summary": "Tingvard judges this governance action unconstitutional.",
    "rationaleStatement": "This governance action is submitted as a Treasury Withdrawals action and is therefore subject to the governance action standards set out in Article II, Section 6 and the mandatory requirements set out in Article II, Section 7 of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution.\nA previously approved Budget Info Action does exist and is referenced by this proposal as the basis for the requested withdrawal. Under the prior constitutional framework, such budget Info actions were treated as having a recognized role in establishing budget expectations for subsequent treasury withdrawals. However, under the current Constitution, budget Info actions are not recognized as binding and are not assigned any constitutional effect.\nThe Constitution assigns all binding budget and treasury requirements exclusively to Treasury Withdrawals actions. It does not recognize prior Info actions as satisfying, supplementing, or substituting for the requirements imposed by Article II, Section 7. As a result, a Treasury Withdrawals action must be fully self contained and must independently satisfy all constitutional requirements, without reliance on external or superseded governance actions.\nThis governance action explicitly relies on a budget approval mechanism that is no longer recognized under the current Constitution. By grounding the withdrawal request in a previously approved Budget Info Action that has no constitutional standing under the current framework, the proposal fails to establish a valid constitutional basis for the requested treasury withdrawal.\nThe Constitution contains no transition or grandfathering provisions that would permit Treasury Withdrawals actions to rely on budget approvals granted under prior constitutional interpretations. In the absence of such provisions, the Constitutional Committee is required to assess this action solely against the Constitution as currently in force.\nAccordingly, because this Treasury Withdrawals action depends on a governance action type that is no longer constitutionally binding, it does not meet the budget related requirements imposed by Article II, Section 7 and must be judged unconstitutional.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "This decision establishes that, under the current Constitution, Treasury Withdrawals actions may not rely on prior Budget Info Actions as a source of constitutional authority. All budget related justification and compliance must be contained within, and evaluated against, the Treasury Withdrawals action itself.",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "It may be argued that reliance on a previously approved Budget Info Action reflects good faith adherence to governance practice at the time of submission. However, the Constitution provides no mechanism for preserving the constitutional effect of governance actions that are no longer recognized as binding. The Constitutional Committee has no authority to apply grandfathering or transition rules absent an on chain governance action establishing them.",
    "conclusion": "Tingvard judges this governance action unconstitutional. Although a previously approved Budget Info Action exists, the current Constitution does not recognize budget Info actions as binding. Because this Treasury Withdrawals action relies on a governance action type that no longer has constitutional effect, it fails to meet the budget related requirements of Article II, Section 7 and cannot be approved.",
