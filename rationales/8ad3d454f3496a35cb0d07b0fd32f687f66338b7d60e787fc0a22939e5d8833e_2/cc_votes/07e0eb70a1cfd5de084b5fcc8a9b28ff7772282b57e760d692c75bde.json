    "summary": "We find this governance action, as proposed, to be constitutional.",
    "rationaleStatement": "The proposal titled \"*Withdraw ₳1,300,000 for Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal*\" is constitutional. Per our constitutionality review, all relevant articles, guardrails, and other requirements of constitutionality were met.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "N/A",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "We, the undersigned, voted against this governance action on constitutional grounds, due to its failure to satisfy the mandatory requirements outlined in **Article IV, Section 4** of the Interim Constitution: \n\n> “Any governance action requesting ada from the Cardano Blockchain treasury shall require an allocation of ada as a part of such funding request to cover the cost of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metrics as to the use of such ada. Contractual obligations governing the use of ada received from the Cardano Blockchain treasury pursuant to a Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget shall include dispute resolution provisions.”\n\nThis section is not advisory. The use of the word “shall” establishes a binding obligation. It requires that any request for ADA from the Treasury include the following:\n\n- A specific allocation of ADA to fund periodic, independent audits\n- Implementation of oversight metrics regarding the use of those funds\n- Contractual obligations that include dispute resolution provisions\n\nAfter careful review, we found that this proposal, along with the other 38 using the same structural template, does not fulfill these requirements in a verifiable or transparent way:\n\n1. In the Motivation section, near the end of the list of work items, it states:\n\n*“Audit & Security Assurance: Engage independent audits and security assurance. Consolidated item”*\n\nThen later, under \"Project Delivery\", there's a vague supporting sentence:\n\n*\"This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\"*\n\nNo specific allocation of ADA for periodic, independent audits was presented. Audit and security assurances are bundled into a generalized budget line, making it impossible to confirm whether independent audits, especially periodic ones, are actually funded as required.\n\n2. *\"A dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\"*\n\nThe Constitution requires oversight metrics regarding the use of funds, not just their withdrawal. Showing that funds were moved on-chain is not the same as providing transparency into how they are applied, whether milestones are met, or how performance is evaluated. Without clearly defined metrics tied to the actual use and outcomes of the treasury funds, this element does not fulfill the constitutional requirement.\n\n3. *\"A written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\"*\n\nThe proposal refers to the existence of off-chain contracts and states they will include dispute resolution clauses, but offers no template, example, or summary clause for review. Without a contract template or clause summary available for review, this constitutional requirement remains unverified and therefore unmet.\n\nGiven that these proposals collectively request over 275 million ADA from the Treasury, the standard of compliance should be exceptionally high. Treasury withdrawals at this scale require clear, demonstrable adherence to every constitutional requirement, with no ambiguity or deferred accountability.\n\nThis dissent is not a rejection of the technical work outlined in the proposal, nor of its potential value to the Cardano ecosystem. It is a principled vote grounded in constitutional responsibility and the need to uphold the Constitution through transparent and accountable governance.",
