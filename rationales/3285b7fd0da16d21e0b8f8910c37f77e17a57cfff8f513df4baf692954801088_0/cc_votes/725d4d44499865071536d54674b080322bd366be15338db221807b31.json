Furthermore, the following elements are insufficient for a treasury withdrawal proposal. (Article 3, Section 5) The explanation of the circumstances under which the 100,000 ADA cannot be recovered (issues with the relevant wallet or system) is not explicitly provided. (Article 4, Section 2) The proposal merely states that the administrator is “DRep,” without specifying who is responsible for what. (Article 4, Section 5) A community-auditable receiving address is not provided.",
    "conclusion": "The request to withdraw 100,000 ADA itself is legitimate, but the 3,000 ADA portion cannot necessarily be deemed constitutional. Furthermore, the information provided is insufficient for a treasury withdrawal governance action. Therefore, we abstain.",
