    "rationaleStatement": "[Constitutional] This governance action was reviewed in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain Constitution, focusing on whether it is appropriate to vote on this type of Info Action and its constitutionality. Originally, discussions arose from the interpretation of Article VII, Section 4, which states that Info Actions generally do not require a vote unless they pertain to budgetary matters.€n€nConstitutional Analysis: 1: Voting Obligation (Article VII, Section 4)= The Constitution states that Info Actions are not subject to mandatory votes except when budget-related. This Info Action relates to Net Change Limit, which governs treasury allocation potential. 2: Community Interpretation and Voting (YES=3 votes)= This Info Action indirectly affects budget and is thus voting-eligible. ABSTAIN-2 votes: The action does not directly allocate funds and is not voting-mandatory. 3: Constitutional Validity= No member claimed this Info Action was unconstitutional. It was unanimously agreed that the proposal complies with the Constitution.",
    "conclusion": "Based on the majority decision (3 YES, 2 ABSTAIN), a vote was cast in favor of this Info Action. Regardless of differing interpretations on voting obligation, no evidence or opinion suggested this proposal was unconstitutional. Therefore, we conclude this Info Action is 'Constitutional'.",
