    "summary": "We consider this governance action to be constitutional.",
    "rationaleStatement": "This proposal operates within the framework of the existing constitutional principles and guardrails. It removes non-binding and advisory provisions, as well as redundant mechanisms such as the Budget Info Action, while clarifying definitions, ensuring the immutability of proposal documents, and applying audit and accountability requirements uniformly to treasury withdrawals. The objective of these changes is to simplify governance and strengthen transparency and accountability. These amendments do not infringe upon the separation of powers among DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee, nor do they alter voting thresholds or undermine constraints imposed by constitutional guardrails. Furthermore, the proposal has been submitted as a formal constitutional update in accordance with the prescribed amendment procedures. Based on the above, we determine that this governance action is constitutional under the spirit and provisions of the Cardano Constitution.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "None",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "As this governance action establishes a constitutional text on-chain, it would have been preferable for the proposal to include, in addition to the reasons for addressing existing issues, a clearer explanation of why the revised wording should be regarded as sufficient as a final constitutional document. Furthermore, given the possibility that this proposal represents the first constitutional amendment, it is noted that there is currently no shared convention governing the treatment of constitutional version numbering. While neither of these points undermines the constitutionality of the proposal, greater clarity and explanation would be desirable in future constitutional amendments in order to enhance the stability, clarity, and public legitimacy of the Constitution, as well as to support the development of clearer operational conventions.",
    "conclusion": "For the reasons stated above, we determine that it is constitutional.",
