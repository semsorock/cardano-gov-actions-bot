    "rationaleStatement": "Article VIII, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution states \"Except as otherwise so provided in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, amendments to this Constitution, including to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, shall be approved by a collective decision-making process, requiring an on-chain governance action by owners of ada satisfying a threshold of no less than 65% of the then active voting stake.\"\n\nThis provision contains two distinct requirements for valid constitutional amendments, being that they \"shall be approved by a collective decision-making process\" and \"requiring an on-chain governance action by owners of ada satisfying a threshold of no less than 65% of the then active voting stake.\"\n\nThe inclusion of both clauses within a single sentence implies that the first clause \"collective decision-making process\" is not redundant, but an intentional and additional constitutional expectation. It suggests that beyond a successful on-chain vote, the amendment should also emerge from an inclusive and structured deliberative process. As a suitable \"collective decision-making process\" has not been defined or agreed via an on-chain Info governance action, the process that was used to agree on the current constitution could therefore be considered as a benchmark.\n\nThe governance action with ID \"gov_action1jxne7hynfd7frcczwumd2eggps4kvy0msjztz9t0mutpy870ksgqqp6vp3p\" and title \"CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION v2.4\", as a new constitution governance action, did not emerge from a \"collective decision-making process\" that the Eastern Cardano Council considers comparable to the process used for agreeing the current constitution.\n\nWe strongly recommend that a constitution amendment process be developed and approved via an on-chain Info governance action.\n\nWe therefore find this governance action **Unconstitutional**.",
