Members of the Constitutional Committee may nevertheless record a vote on-chain regarding an \"Info\" action in order to express their view on such \"Info\" action, including whether the suggested course of action proposed in such \"Info\" action, would be, in the view of such member, unconstitutional if it were to be enforced by on-chain mechanisms.\"\n\nFinally; Article VII, Section 4, Paragraph 3 states \"In the case of “Info” actions that propose a Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget, Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the \"Info\" action, would violate this Constitution.\"\n\nThe governance action with ID \"gov_action1n9hdlcmshrj3hee4g8n4fxdgrprpxp0r03l6psd3j0evtpck0nrsqm57age\" and title \"Defining the Cardano 2030 Vision & Strategy\", as an Info governance action, does not relate to a budget proposal, nor does it gauge sentiment towards another type of governance action which could be enacted on-chain, so the Constitutional Committee is not empowered to assess its constitutionality, ensuring DReps and SPOs are the only ones able to influence its outcome.\n\nWe therefore **Abstain**.",
