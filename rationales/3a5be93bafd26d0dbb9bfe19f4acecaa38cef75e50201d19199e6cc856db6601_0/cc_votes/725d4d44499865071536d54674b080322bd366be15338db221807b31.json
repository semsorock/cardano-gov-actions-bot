    "rationaleStatement": "This proposal is an Information (Info) Action intended to share the Cardano 2030 Vision, Mission, Strategy Framework, and KPIs with the community. It does not entail any protocol changes, constitutional amendments, treasury withdrawals, nor does it impose any legally binding effect on future voting behavior. The proposal satisfies the submission requirements set forth in Article III, Section 5 of the Cardano Constitution, and is therefore considered constitutional.",
    "precedentDiscussion": "None",
    "counterargumentDiscussion": "The achievement of the proposed KPIs will critically depend on future governance and budget processes. Without clearly identifying which entities are responsible for committing to these KPIs, and without aligning treasury allocations accordingly in subsequent annual budgets, there is a significant risk that these targets will remain aspirational rather than operational, and their practical realization may be materially undermined.",
    "conclusion": "For the reasons stated above, we determine that it is constitutional.",
