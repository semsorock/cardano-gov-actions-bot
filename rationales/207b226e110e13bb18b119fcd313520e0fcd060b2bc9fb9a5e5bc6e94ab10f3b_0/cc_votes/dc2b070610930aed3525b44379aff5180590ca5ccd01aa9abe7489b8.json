    "summary": " EMURGO as a Constitutional Committee member determines that the governance action titled “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution v2.0” is Constitutional.\n",
    "rationaleStatement": "According to Article III, Section 5 of the Cardano Constitution, all proposed governance actions must follow a clear and standardized format before being recorded or enacted on-chain. This includes providing a URL and hash of all documented off-chain materials to the Cardano Blockchain. Proposals are also required to include sufficient rationale to justify the requested change, with at least a title, abstract, explanation of the proposal, and supporting documents. This proposal has met all of those requirements, providing sufficient context and information for DReps to make an informed decision.\n\nAlso based on Article VIII, Section 2 of the Cardano Constitution, amendments may be made through an on-chain governance action approved by ada holders with no less than 65% of active voting stake. This governance action follows that prescribed process and therefore satisfies the constitutional requirements.\n\nThat said, we highlight Article VIII, Section 1, which encourages the Cardano Community to periodically review, debate, and socialize proposed amendments before they are brought on-chain. While not binding, this principle underlines the importance of inclusivity and legitimacy in constitutional change. In this case, feedback continued to surface after submission, suggesting that wider ecosystem discussion and consensus-building were limited.\n\nFor future constitutional amendments, EMURGO strongly encourages proposers to invest greater effort in socialization, open debate, and community engagement before submission. This ensures not only the formal validity of amendments but also their broad acceptance and alignment with the community’s collective vision.\n",
    "conclusion": "In conclusion, EMURGO concludes this proposal is constitutional, but future amendments should prioritize broader discussion and consensus to strengthen legitimacy and trust in the governance process.",
